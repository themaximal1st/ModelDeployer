## Model Deployer makes it easy to use AI in your apps

Any app developer that wants to use AI models in their apps has a few questions to answer:

Do you charge a subscription?
Do you charge based on usage?
Do your users signup with their API key?
Do you have a free tier?
How do you rate limit users and prevent someone from running up your bill?
What if your users want to use their own models for privacy?

**Model Deployer was created to solve all of these problems and more.**

AI models are great, but using them in your app can be tricky because they aren't free! If you run a high-magin SaaS business, you can probably fold it into your costs.

But all kinds of user-facing apps struggle with the economics of using expensive AI models.

Model Deployer solves these problems, by making it easy to use lots of different models in the same interface, tracking their usage, rate limiting, and offering ways to charge your users.

But we've gone even further, because Model Deployer is 100% MIT open-source software, and you can run it yourself for your users. Your users can even run—giving everyone in the ecosystem options.
